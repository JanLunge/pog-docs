# Intro

Pog aims to make it easy to modify your keymap for kmk based keyboard with an intuitive GUI.
In addition, you can also create a keyboard firmware through the setup wizard. This allows you to add kmk support to most keyboards
without knowledge in python or coding at all.

## Other tools

There are quite a few tools available for this exact tasks:
* via / vial for qmk
* peg for kmk

So why write another tool for this purpose? Well all of these are not exactly focused on the needs of those that are actually building new keyboards.
While building quite a few from scratch the methods to create layouts with the keyboard-layout-editor.com and labeling each key by hand with their matrix positions just got way too tedious for myself.

That's why we now have pog a **hopefully** awesome and opensource keyboard configurator.
