# Installation of POG

Pog is written in electron, and we have builds supporting Windows & OSX.

:::tip Linux
Linux is technically supported but for now you would need to bundle the application yourself because of an error 
I encounter when working with electron-builder & multipass to build for Linux from OSX
:::

Download the latest release from [Gitub](https://github.com/JanLunge/pog/releases/)

## OSX
for OSX you would open the .dmg file and move pog to your application folder.
when opening the app you will likely get prompted that the app is unsafe as it is not signed yet. To work around this 
open the app with right-clicking it and then selecting open.

## Windows
on Windows you can either choose the installer or use the standalone .exe. You will likely be promted for security as 
well as the app is not signed for windows yet.
