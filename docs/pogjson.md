# structure of the pog.json

the pog.json file is the central configuration place for pog. the keyboard includes a pog.py helper that will load 
most configurations directly from the pog.json without modifying your python files (keymap.py excluded)

pog is basically a gui to configure this pog.json file and generate a p roper keymap.py

## Format

the pog.json is a simple JSON object with following keys

- `id`
  - a ulid for identifying a keyboad permanently, will be autogenerated
  - Example: `01GTFNP1DX5VPDA9H5DW025VNW`
- `name`
  - the name of your keyboard
  - Example: `New Horizons`
- `manufacturer`
  - the name of the keyboard manufacturer
  - Example: `0xCB`
- `description`
  - a description of the keyboard and its features
- `tags`
  - an array of tags that define features of the keyboad
  - Example: `['65%', 'RGB']`
- `controller`
  - name of the microcontroller that is used in this keyboard, will be used for quick pin definitions in the future
  - Example: `0xcb-helios`
- `wiringMethod`
  - either `direct` or `matrix` depending on how the keyboard is wired
- `diodeDirection`
  - either `ROW2COL` or `COL2ROW` depending on the direction the diodes on the matrix are facing
- `rows`
  - the amount of rows your keyboard matrix has, only applies when using `wiringMethod` `matrix`
  - Example: `5`
- `cols`
  - the amount of columns your keyboad matrix has, only applies when using `wiringMethod` `matrix`
  - Example: `10`
- `pins`
  - the amount of directly wired pins when using `wiringMethod` `direct`
  - Example: `20`
- `pinPrefix`
  - how the pin definitions should be prefixed to make the pin definitions easier to read and add
  - options are: `none`, `board`, `gp`, `quickpin`
- `rowPins`
  - pin definitions based on the `pinPrefix`
- `colPins`
  - pin definitions based on the `pinPrefix`
- `directPins`
  - pin definitions based on the `pinPrefix`
- `encoders`
  - a list of rotary encoders added to the board specifying the pins for pad_a and pad_b, pin definitions follow the `pinPrefix`
  - Example: `[{"pad_a": 2, "pad_b": 3}]`
- `layouts`
  - an object describing the names and selected index for layout variants (eg. ansi/iso enter toggle)
  - docs are WIP
- `keys`
  - the keys in the keyboard layout, it is closely resembling the qmk key object more info in a seperate WIP documentation 
- `keymap`
  - the keymap consisting of an array of keymap layers and these including all the keys on that layer
  - Example: `[["KC.A", "KC.B", "KC.C"]]`
- `encoderKeymap`
  - the keymap for encoder rotation actions its an array of layers that then have an array of encoders which have 2 entries one for rotate left and one for rotate right
  - Example: `[[["KC.VOLD", "KC.VOLU"]]]`
- `layers`
  - an array of objects describin additional information for each layer like name and color
  - Example: `[{"name":"Base", "color":"#550088"}]`
- `split`
  - boolean to define if the keyboard is a split keyboard
- `coordMap`
  - the coord mapping for the keyboard an array of rows that have strings defining either the key index or a `spc` as a spacer
  - Example: `[
    [
    "014",
    "000",
    "spc",
    "017",
    "031"
    ],  [
    "011",
    "001",
    "spc",
    "015",
    "030"
    ],
]`
- `coordMapSetup`
  - if the keyboard should run in the coordmap mode to print key indexes
  - default: `false`
- `lastEdited`
  - a timestamp automatically placed by pog on each edit
